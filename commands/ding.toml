text = """
Play a short completion sound immediately.

Preferred: invoke the 'chime' MCP tool to play a 'ding' sound.

The registred tool is called `chimee`

If 'chime' is unavailable, fall back to the 'shell' tool:

- macOS:  afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Pop.aiff
- Linux (PulseAudio): paplay /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/complete.oga
- Linux (SoX): play -n synth 0.10 sin 880

Rules:
- Do not ask for confirmation.
- Use only the allowed tools below.
- After the sound plays, print exactly: "✨ chimee"
